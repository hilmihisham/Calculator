A calculator program using Java Swing as the GUI.

No, not yet.. I haven't figure out how to release the app just yet.

## Does it work?
Oh yes. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division works like how you would expect from a simple calculator. It's a calculator after all..

Also, the '%' button works as a mod, rather than percentage.

## Where's the project came from?
This is actually the first project for my COMP 585 - GUI class. The project was due on 18 Sept 2018 and was already finished by then (for all the required functionality for the project), but I'm still continuing this project after that - adding more functionality, updating the looks, and etc etc mostly for fun. 

## Project Updates

  - Initial project finished, with all basic functionality implemented.
